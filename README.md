# Hi ðŸ‘‹

You may know me as Devonte or "Devnote" (that meme went on for too long). I code for fun with different languages (Python, JS, TS, and more). You can find me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XyZQ2U4vA6) or Guilded!

*Note: I'll probably update this properly at a later date*

## Current (Public) Projects
You can find out more about my other projects in my "testing" server (link above).

### Thanks for reading ðŸ‘‹
